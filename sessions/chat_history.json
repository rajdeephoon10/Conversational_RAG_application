Pruning: This technique removes unnecessary parameters from the model, reducing its size.\n2. Quantization: This technique reduces the precision of the model's weights and activations, making it smaller and more efficient.\n3. Low-rank factorization: This technique reduces the dimensionality of the model's weights, making it smaller and more efficient.\n4. Knowledge distillation: This technique involves training a smaller model to mimic the behavior of a larger model, allowing it to learn the same concepts and achieve similar performance.\n\nThese techniques can impact model performance in various ways, such as:\n\n- Maintaining or even improving performance (e.g., GPT-4o mini surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo in language understanding and other benchmarks).\n- Reducing latency and increasing inference speed (e.g., fewer parameters translate to decreased processing times).\n- Improving environmental sustainability and reducing energy consumption.\n\nSources: \n- Techniques for reducing SLM size (filename: How SLMs Are Created: Techniques, page numbers not available)\n- Impact on model performance (filename: Benefits of small language models, page numbers not available)"
